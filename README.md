## Purpose
This is an application for when you don't know what to watch. or You say you'll add a movie or show recommendation to "your list" but then never do because it doesn't actually exist at all. So, this is built for a user to adda show or movie, they can specify which it is and then also the genre. Then, the user can later come back to this application and click "give me a show or movie and it will give them the name of something to watch. They can also just press "Surprise me" and it will give either a tv show or movie of any genre. Ideally the user will also be able to specify within the movie or tv show options to pick a genre. At the moment it is unclear if the genres are going to be the normal strict "comedy, drama, mystery etc" or based on vibes, so the user can pick "I'm feeling like something funny" and then the show might not be so restrictive in terms of genres, so it would inclued dark comedys and stuff under the "funny" vibe.
